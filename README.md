Using Inheritance-Polymorphism in java to provide information on staffs of ICT faculty


Faculty of ICT has staffs in several different positions. These positions include Lecturers, Administrative, and Technical staffs. You have been asked to create a program for tracking information about each of KICT staffs. The information consists of: the staffâ€™s name, job title (e.g. senior lecturer, professor, admin officer, secretary etc.), and staff ID (in the range of 1 to 1000). Additionally:
- Each lecturer must have a list of courses that they teach. A lecturer can teach up to 4 courses.
- Administrative staffs must have a list of skills that they have. E.g. secretarial, clerical, data entry etc.

The solution will provide the following:
a.	Including relevant attributes and methods for all the classes. The classes should consist of at least i) overloading constructor, ii) getter and setter method for each attributes (getName, setName, getJobTitle, setJobTitle, setCourse, getCourse etc.)
b.	Providing the test class to test the above classes. The program should display information about each staff. For a lecturer, display the name, staff ID and list of courses that they taught. For admin staff, display their name, staff, ID, and list of skills that they possessed. 
c.	Using Random numbers to calculate unique staff ID (range from 1 to 1000).
